class Model:
    """
    The base model class for 
    [compartmental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology). 
    Compartmental models are models composed of various sub-models, 
    known as "compartments." For example, the common SIR model is an 
    example of a compartmental model with the Susceptible, Infected, 
    and Removed compartments.

    def __init__(self, initial_population, comps=None, comp_map=None, 
                 matrix=None):
        """
        Initialize the `Model` class; all optional parameters can be 
        added through the `epispot.models.Model.add` method.

        ## **Parameters**

        `initial_population`: Population at time zero

        `comps=None`: List of compartment classes to create the model

        `comp_map=None`: Map of how all the compartments connect.
                         The map should consist of a list of lists.
                         Each sublist represents the connections of the 
                         corresponding compartment in the `comps` list.
                         This sublist should contain the indices of each 
                         of the compartments in `comps` that it connects to.
                         If the compartment does not connect to any other 
                         compartments, leave the sublist blank.
        
        `matrix=None`: Rate and probability matrix describing the 
                       exchange rates between compartments. Like `map`,
                       this is a list of lists. Unlike `map`, however,
                       this matrix must not skip entries (i.e. no blank
                       sublists). Each sublist should contain rate and 
                       probability information in a tuple for every 
                       compartment. If the information is not 
                       necessary, use the tuple `(1, 1)` or `None` as a
                       placeholder.

        ## **Example**

        Let's say we have three compartments `A`, `B`, and `C`.
        These three compartments connect as shown below:

        ```text
        ┌───────────────────┐
        │                   ▼
        ┌───┐     ┌───┐     ┌───┐
        │ A │ ──▶ │ C │ ──▶ │ B │
        └───┘     └───┘     └───┘
        ```

        To create a compartmental model with these three classes, use:

        ```python
        comps = [A, B, C], 
        map = [
            [1, 2],     # A
            [],         # B
            [1]         # C
        ],
        matrix = [
            [None, (1/2, 1/3), (1/2, 1/3)],     # A[A, B, C] 
            [None, None, None],                 # B[A, B, C]
            [None, (1/2, 1/3), None]            # C[A, B, C]
        ]
        ```

        This creates a compartmental model where all the connections 
        have a probability of `1/2` and rate of `1/3`.
