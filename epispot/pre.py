"""
This module (short for 'pre-compiled') contains models that have already been compiled and can be put to use immediately.
Each function returns an `epispot.models.Model` object and its corresponding methods. 
Model parameters can still be changed even after compilation, but this will require recompilation which can be performed with:

```python
Model.compile(custom=False)
# if adding custom compartments: 
Model.compile(custom=True)
```

def SIR(R_0, gamma, N):
    """
    The well-known 
    [SIR Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model);
    a staple of epidemiology and the most basic tool for modeling 
    infectious diseases.

    Susceptible → Infected → Removed

    ## Parameters

    `R_0 (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The 
        [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number),
        indicating how infectious a given disease is.
        A value of above 1 indicates a high probability of transmission and thus an increasing infected population.
        A value of 1 indicates a low probability of transmission and thus a constant infected population.
        A value below 1 indicates a low probability of transmission and also a decreasing infected population.

    `gamma (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The total recovery rate of patients.
        This is *not* a measure of how long it takes patients in any given compartment to recover but rather a measure of one divided by the average time of infectiousness.

    `N`: The initial population size; should be the same as that passed into the `epispot.models.Model` class.

    ## Returns

    A `epispot.models.Model` object

def SEIR(R_0, gamma, N, delta):
    """
    An extension on the basic 
    [SIR Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model)
    to include an 'exposed' compartment useful for modeling contact tracing.
    This is known as the 
    [SEIR Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model)
    and is commonly used for diseases that have long incubation periods.

    Susceptible → Exposed → Infected → Removed

    ## Parameters

    `R_0 (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The 
        [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number),
        indicating how infectious a given disease is.
        A value of above 1 indicates a high probability of transmission and thus an increasing infected population.
        A value of 1 indicates a low probability of transmission and thus a constant infected population.
        A value below 1 indicates a low probability of transmission and also a decreasing infected population.

    `gamma (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The total recovery rate of patients.
        This is *not* a measure of how long it takes patients in any given compartment to recover but rather a measure of one divided by the average time of infectiousness.

    `N (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The initial population size;
        should be the same as that passed into the `epispot.models.Model` class.

    `delta (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The reciprocal of the incubation period for the disease.
        This is one divided by the time it takes an individual to transition from the `epispot.comps.Exposed` compartment to the `epispot.comps.Infected` compartment.

def SIRD(R_0, gamma, N, alpha, rho=1.0):
    """
    An addition to the 
    [SIR Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model),
    which separates the `epispot.comps.Removed` compartment into the `epispot.comps.Recovered` compartment and the `epispot.comps.Dead` compartment.

    Susceptible → Infected → Recovered, Dead

    ## Parameters

    `R_0 (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The 
        [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number),
        indicating how infectious a given disease is.
        A value of above 1 indicates a high probability of transmission and thus an increasing infected population.
        A value of 1 indicates a low probability of transmission and thus a constant infected population.
        A value below 1 indicates a low probability of transmission and also a decreasing infected population.

    `gamma (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The total recovery rate of patients.
        This is *not* a measure of how long it takes patients in any given compartment to recover but rather a measure of one divided by the average time of infectiousness.

    `N (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The initial population size;
        should be the same as that passed into the `epispot.models.Model` class.

    `alpha (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The probability of death
        (often referred to as—but not to be confused with—the 'death rate')
        for a certain disease.
        This is the percentage of individuals that are infected with the disease that will die.

    `rho=1.0 (float|func(t: float)->float)`: The reciprocal of the average time before death.
        This is the real 'death *rate*' of the disease, which represents the *time* of death rather than its probability.
