## Issues

### I found a bug.

When creating an issue, you will be prompted to choose a template. Choose `BUG_REPORT` and fill in the required information before submitting the issue.

### I have a feature request.

When creating the issue, you will also be prompted to choose a template. Choose `FEATURE_REQUEST` and fill out the template with any information that you have.

### I found a security vulnerability.

Check out the steps outlined in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and submit the issue after verifying that the vulnerability still exists on a supported version.

### Neither.

Create a blank issue and include as much information as possible about the problem you're facing.
If this is a usage problem, consider opening a discussion rather than an issue.
